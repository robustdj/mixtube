## About

Sinatra-DataMapper-Template is a little template to help you quickly start work
on your Sinatra/DataMapper projects without worrying about writing too much
boilerplate code. Here's a list of its features:

 - Basic `app.rb` file with DataMapper setup and a couple routes
 - RSpec testing
 - Ready for deploying to Heroku
 - Includes my HTML5 template, which includes jQuery and Eric Meyer's CSS reset
